Example of modules.

To run the example cd into the main directory.
Also when you look at help in stackoverflow you may see something like this:

$ cd /pathtothething/main/

This means to type in "cd /pathtothething/main/" not "$ cd /pathtothething/main/"
The "$" stands for shell command, which is a fancy way to say console command.

Try running main/main.py, then running main/modules/mathematics.py

Now for your assignment:

1. Create something similar to the main/ directory (remember the __init__.py!)
2. Turn your is_prime() into a module, then run it in a different file! (Kind
  of like how I ran classes from mathematics.py from main.py)
